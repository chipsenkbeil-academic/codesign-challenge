Codesign Challenge
==================

The hardware/software codesign challenge for ECE4530 where we attempt to beat
each other in speeding up SHA-1 and collision detection.

This project contains the following directories:
* archives: The project archives containing the Quartus information and the
            reference implementation.
* doc:      Contains all of my documentation on my work through the project,
            serving as the basis for my report on the project.
* img:      Contains all images associated with my documentation such as
            screenshots of output from the code execution as well as my
            diagrams of how I attempted to optimize the design.
* src:      The source code (both C and Verilog) that I wrote to optimize
            my design. My QSYS alterations are not found here, but can be
            found in the final submission archive located in the _archives_
            directory.
